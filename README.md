Imaginary Tech Solutions - Discount Registration

This project provides a user-friendly interface for registering for discounts on imaginary products offered by Imaginary Tech Solutions. It utilizes a Docker container for easy deployment and scalability.

Features:

Form to register for discounts with name, email, product, coupon (optional), city, country, and address.
User interface with a modern design and clear instructions.
Basic validation of user input (required fields).
Server-side processing of discount registration using PDO and SQLite.
Ability to display a random coupon code upon user request.
Technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP (PDO for database interaction)
Database: SQLite (within the container)
Containerization: Docker
Setup:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/imaginary-discount-registration.git
Use code with caution.

Build the Docker image:

Bash
cd imaginary-discount-registration
docker build -t imaginary-discount .
Use code with caution.

Run the container:

Bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 imaginary-discount
Use code with caution.

This command creates a detached container (-d) and exposes port 80 of the container to port 8080 of your host machine (-p 8080:80).
Accessing the application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the discount registration form.

Usage:

Fill in the required information on the form.
Optionally, click the "Show Random Coupon" button to generate a random coupon code.
Click the "Register for Discount" button to submit your registration.
The server will process your request and display a success message if the registration is successful.

Notes:

This application uses a SQLite database stored within the Docker container. For production environments, consider using a more robust database solution.
The random coupon code generation functionality is for demonstration purposes only and should be replaced with a more secure implementation for real-world usage.
